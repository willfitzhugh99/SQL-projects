    "The following is a quick report on the TechChalk project \"Angie Berry SQL Task\". I wanted to answer the questions posed in this project using SQL queries, so loaded the .csv files into a database using mySQL in DBeaver. Below is an ERD of the data used in this analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"pics/erd.png\" width=\"300\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "First things first, I set up my environment and altered the date columns to fit mySQL date time format:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"pics/environment.png\" width=\"900\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "I then changed the data type for these variabels through the properties tab:\n",
    "<img src=\"pics/date_type.png\" width=\"300\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "#### Now the querying can begin.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first question is \"What is Angie’s Berry Corner’s average daily sales volume?\".\n",
    "<img src=\"pics/query1.png\" width=\"500\"/>\n",
    "The answer is Angie's Berry Corner sold an average of 3,408.55 units per day between 6/1/2019 and the end of the day on 8/19/2019.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The next quesiton asks about the best selling products at Angie's Berry Corner.\n",
    "<img src=\"pics/query2.png\" width=\"200\"/>\n",
    "We can see that all products sell relatively equal amounts, but Honeydew is the most popular item.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Who are the top 5 loyalty customers for Angie's Berry Corner?\n",
    "<img src=\"pics/query3.png\" width=\"350\"/>\n",
    "Xenia Veart is the top loyalty customer, and by a long shot. Strangly, she is also listed as an emplyee of the company, which we will see later. Maybe she owns a competing berry business and secretly enjoys a employee discount on Angie's berries. This is suspicious, and I will investigate this later to make sure nothing fishy is going on.\n",
    "\n",
    "The next question asks \"What are the full names of Angie's employees?\".\n",
    "<img src=\"pics/query4.png\" width=\"300\"/>\n",
    "Now that we've established Xenia has been employed by Angie, let's look at some more information on her.\n",
    "<img src=\"pics/query7.png\" width=\"700\"/>\n",
    "We can see here that Xenia's employment ended right around the time that she made here last purchase, so Angie must have taken care of business. Nothing to worry about.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that taht's taken care of, there are a series of questions asking about revenue generated by different products at Angie's Berry Corner, all of which can be asnwered by this query:\n",
    "<img src=\"pics/query5.png\" width=\"300\"/>\n",
    "As all products were generally sold in equal amounts, the highest priced products generated the most revenue for the company. 'Imbe' generated the most revenue, while 'Kiwi' generated the least, followed closely by 'Banana'.\n",
    "\n",
    "Who are the longest serving employees with the company?\n",
    "<img src=\"pics/query6.png\" width=\"300\"/>\n",
    "Delmer Plackstone is the longest serving empoyee, and Federica Trinke is the longest serving active employee.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, the project asks for the highest and lowest spending customers. The follwoing query shows the highest spending customers, excluding those without a customer_id and Xenia Veart:\n",
    "<img src=\"pics/query8.png\" width=\"400\"/>\n",
    "Anallese Deinhardt is the Angie's best customer, who isn't likely stealing from her somehow. To find the lowest spending customers, you could switch the \"desc\" in the query to \"asc\", and you would find there are number of loyalty customers who have only purchased one item, which isn't very intersting.\n",
    "\n",
    "Lasty, the projects asks for the company's busiest hour of day, day of week and month within the recorded period. Answers to these questions are below:\n",
    "<img src=\"pics/query9.png\" width=\"400\"/>\n",
    "Angie's busiest hour was first thing in the morning at 8am.\n",
    "<img src=\"pics/query10.png\" width=\"450\"/>\n",
    "Angie's busiest day of the week was Saturday, followed closely by Sunday. \n",
    "<img src=\"pics/query11.png\" width=\"450\"/>\n",
    "Angie's busiest recorded month was June.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "Thanks for looking through the SQL queries I used to answer the questions posed in TechChalk's SQL task project."
